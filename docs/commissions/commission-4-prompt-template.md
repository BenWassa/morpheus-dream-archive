## The Prompt

I just had a dream. Here's my raw voice dump:

Please organize this dream into the following structure. **Important**: Preserve the dream's natural logic—don't rationalize impossible elements, sudden transitions, or identity shifts. Dreams don't follow waking logic, and that's what makes them worth preserving.

**Output this exact format:**

### Scene Breakdown
Identify 3-7 key moments as distinct scenes. Each scene should be:
- A specific location or situation
- 2-3 sentences describing what happened
- Preserve "suddenly I was..." transitions
- Keep identity fluidity ("my friend but also my brother")
- Maintain spatial contradictions ("the beach was also inside my house")

Number each scene.

---

### Core Summary
Write 2-3 sentences capturing the emotional arc and main experience of the dream. Focus on the feeling and atmosphere, not literal events.

---

### Visual Moments
For the 3-5 most visually striking or emotionally intense scenes, write image generation prompts. Each should be:
- One sentence
- Focused on mood and atmosphere over literal accuracy
- Capture what it *felt* like, not just what happened
- Style: surreal, dreamlike, cinematic

Format: "Scene [number]: [prompt description]"

---

### Keywords
List 5-8 single-word or short-phrase tags:
- Recurring symbols (water, doors, mirrors)
- Emotions (anxiety, joy, confusion)
- Settings (childhood home, forest, ocean)
- Recurring characters or entities

Comma-separated list.

---

### Fragments
Any disconnected flashes, brief moments, or details that don't fit cleanly into scenes but feel significant. List each on a new line.

If none exist, write "None"

## Example Output Format

### Scene Breakdown
1. I was in my childhood kitchen, but the walls were breathing. Water was rising from the floor tiles, pooling around my ankles. Everything felt both familiar and completely wrong.

2. My father appeared in the doorway, but he was the age I am now. He didn't recognize me. He asked if I'd seen his daughter.

3. Suddenly I was outside. The house had become an island in the middle of an endless ocean. The sky was the wrong color—a deep purple I've never seen in waking life.

### Core Summary
A dream about returning to a familiar space that has become alien and unstable. The emotional core was a mix of nostalgia and dislocation, with a thread of loss running through the changing identities and disappearing spaces.

### Visual Moments
Scene 1: Childhood kitchen flooding with dark water, walls subtly distorting, warm dim light through windows, atmosphere of creeping wrongness

Scene 2: Middle-aged man in doorway backlit by strange light, expression of confusion and searching, dreamlike soft focus

Scene 3: Small house on tiny island surrounded by vast purple-sky ocean, impossible perspective, sense of isolation and awe

### Keywords
water, childhood home, father, transformation, loss, ocean, disorientation, identity

### Fragments
- There was a red door that shouldn't have existed
- My dog was there for a moment, then wasn't
- Someone was calling my name but I couldn't tell from where
- The water tasted like salt even though it was coming from the floor
