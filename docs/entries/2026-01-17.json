  "originalTranscription": "I was coming outside from a shop that felt like an upscale one-stop storefront selling jewelry and perfume, with people checking others in for a gym upstairs. I was heading to the gym, greeting and chatting with many people comfortably. There was a woman rehabbing from an injury, and I offered help respectfully, which she declined. I mentioned I had to go solve a coding problem. While walking toward an escalator to go upstairs, I was untangling a stainless steel necklace chain in my hands. Abruptly, the scene shifted to a sandy beach at low tide with wet ground exposed. I was alone, holding a hunting rifle, when a large brown grizzly bear began running toward me. I knew how to shoot it properly, aiming for the heart, but I did not want to do it and almost wished the gun would jam. I felt conflict and sadness at harming such a powerful, beautiful creature.",
  "summary": "The dream moves from a social, controlled environment of self-improvement and problem-solving to an exposed shoreline where a powerful bear must be confronted. It centers on competence paired with restraint, highlighting care without control and reluctance to use force despite knowing how.",
