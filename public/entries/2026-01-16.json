  "originalTranscription": "I was walking through a huge unfinished building that felt like a mix between a university, an airport, and an office tower. Some hallways were pristine and modern, others were crumbling or blocked off. I kept carrying different bags with me, but every time I set one down to pick up another, I felt anxious that I was abandoning something important. At one point I found a control room filled with glowing screens showing projects, timelines, and symbols I recognized but couldn't fully read. A voice told me I had plenty of time, but the building lights kept dimming. I tried to find an exit, but each door led me deeper inside instead of outside.",
  "summary": "A restless dream about unfinished structures, competing responsibilities, and the pressure to integrate many paths into a coherent whole. The emotional arc moves from curiosity and competence into quiet urgency, with a lingering tension between having time and fearing loss.",
